I am currently a research associate in Dr. Bortz' lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work at the intersection of dynamical systems, data science, and mathematical biology. My main interests include algorithms for data-driven modeling, and the analysis and simulation of complex phenomena across multiple scales, from particle to continuum descriptions.

Apart from research, my hobbies include playing music, cooking, biking, snowboarding, and generally being out in the wilderness.

Please check out my [CV](/assets/docs/CV/CV.pdf) and contact me if you're interested collaborating.
