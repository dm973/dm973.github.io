I am a Director's Postdoctoral Fellow in the T-5 Division (Theoretical Physics and Applied Mathematics) at Los Alamos National Labs. I work at the intersection of physical applied math and scientific machine learning. My main interests include algorithms for data-driven modeling and the analysis and simulation of multiscale phenomena.

Apart from research, I enjoy playing music, cooking, biking, snowboarding, and generally being out in the wilderness.

Please check out my [CV](/assets/docs/CV/CV.pdf) and contact me if you're interested collaborating.
