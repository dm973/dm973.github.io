I"ƒ<p>I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in Dr. Bortzâ€™ lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work at the intersection of dynamical systems, data science, and mathematical biology. My main interests include algorithms for data-driven modeling, and the analysis and simulation of complex phenomena across multiple scales, from particle to continuum descriptions.</p>

<p>Apart from research, my hobbies include playing music, cooking, biking, snowboarding, and generally being out in the wilderness.</p>
