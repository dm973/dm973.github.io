abstract = {Operator theoretic methods in dynamical system have been dominated by the use of Koopman operators and their continuous time counterparts, such as Koopman Generators and Liouville Operators. The advantage gained from their use primarily stems from the ability to extract subspaces and eigenfunctions within a space of observables that are invariant with respect to the Koopman operator over that space. When this occurs, a dynamic mode decomposition of the systems state provides a linear model for the dynamical system. Not all Koopman operators have eigenfunctions that may be exploited in this manner. However, the framework can still be leveraged for approximations using other operators. In this setting, we present a different operator for the study of dynamical systems, the weighted composition operator. These operators are compact for a wide range of dynamics and spaces, and through their interactions with occupation kernels and vector valued kernels, they admit an estimation of the underlying dynamics. This manuscript presents a new algorithm for the data driven study of dynamical systems from data, and also provides two numerical experiments where convergence is achieved as a proof of concept.}

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of linear diffusion and interactions with the domain boundary on swarm equilibria by analyzing critical points of the associated energy functional. Through this process we uncover two properties of energy minimization that depend explicitly on the spatial domain: (i) unboundedness from below of the energy due to an imbalance between diffusive and aggregative forces depends explicitly on a certain volume filling property of the domain, and (ii) metastable mass translation occurs in domains without sufficient symmetry. From the first property, we present a sharp condition for existence (respectively non-existence) of global minimizers in a large class of domains, analogous to results in free space, and from the second property, we identify that external forces are necessary to confine the swarm and grant existence of global minimizers in general domains. We also introduce a numerical method for computing critical points of the energy and give examples to motivate further research.},

As in the case of ODE discovery, the weak form replaces pointwise approximation of derivatives with local integrations against test functions and achieves effective machine-precision recovery of weights from noise-free data (i.e. below the tolerance of the simulation scheme) as well as natural robustness to noise without the use of noise filtering. The resulting WSINDy\_PDE algorithm uses separable test functions implemented efficiently via convolutions for discovery of PDE models with computational complexity \$O(NM)\$ from data points with \$M = N{\textasciicircum}\{D+1\}\$ points, or \$N\$ points in each of \$D+1\$ dimensions. We demonstrate on several notoriously challenging PDEs the speed and accuracy with which WSINDy\_PDE recovers the correct models from datasets with surprisingly large levels noise (often with levels of noise much greater than 10\%).},

	abstract = {We present a weak formulation and discretization of the system discovery problem from noisy measurement data. This method of learning differential equations from data fits into a new class of algorithms that replace pointwise derivative approximations with linear transformations and a variance reduction technique. Our approach improves on the standard SINDy algorithm by orders of magnitude. We first show that in the noise-free regime, this so-called Weak SINDy (WSINDy) framework is capable of recovering the dynamic coefficients to very high accuracy, with the number of significant digits equal to the tolerance of the data simulation scheme. Next we show that the weak form naturally accounts for white noise by identifying the correct nonlinearities with coefficient error scaling favorably with the signal-to-noise ratio while significantly reducing the size of linear systems in the algorithm. In doing so, we combine the ease of implementation of the SINDy algorithm with the natural noise-reduction of integration to arrive at a more robust and user-friendly method of sparse recovery that correctly identifies systems in both small-noise and large-noise regimes.},

  abstract = 	 {This paper presents an online algorithm for identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) based on the weak-form sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm (WSINDy). The algorithm is online in a sense that if performs the identification task by processing solution snapshots that arrive sequentially. The core of the method combines a weak-form discretization of candidate PDEs with an online proximal gradient descent approach to the sparse regression problem. In particular, we do not regularize the $\ell_0$-pseudo-norm, instead finding that directly applying its proximal operator (which corresponds to a hard thresholding) leads to efficient online system identification from noisy data. We demonstrate the success of the method on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the nonlinear wave equation with time-varying wavespeed, and the linear wave equation, in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, respectively. In particular, our examples show that the method is capable of identifying and tracking systems with coefficients that vary abruptly in time, and offers a streaming alternative to problems in higher dimensions.}
