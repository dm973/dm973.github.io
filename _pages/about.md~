I am an applied mathematician conducting research at the intersection of dynamical systems, data science, and mathematical biology. My main interests include algorithms for data-driven modeling, and the analysis and simulation of complex phenomena across multiple scales, from the discete (particle) level to continuous (hydrodynamic) descriptions. I also enjoy teaching and learning about a wide variety of mathematical subjects and phenomena in the natural and social sciences.
