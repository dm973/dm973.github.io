My [PhD dissertation](/assets/docs/phddiss/out.pdf) concerns the WSINDy algorithm (Weak-Form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics) designed by myself and David Bortz (see [1](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/20M1343166) and [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999121004204?casa_token=KVNE-MMFUzQAAAAA:YiJmD5u2WEpGSATKB20oEhXi-sv6HeGY-pHCN3AQnPuYoUBoQYVriawyHyyJ-sgGjbYi6lCzO8k)). WSINDy uses weak-formulations of dynamical systems to perform model selection and parameter estimation.

My [Masters thesis](/assets/docs/mthes/out.pdf) includes analysis and computational results concerning aggregation-diffusion phenomena, a ubiquitous modeling paradigm in mathematical biology and collective behaviour more generally.

Joint investigations of collective behaviour and model selection using WSINDy have been carried out [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278922001543?via%3Dihub) and [4](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2022.0412).
